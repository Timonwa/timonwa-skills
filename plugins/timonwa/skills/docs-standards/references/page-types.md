# The four docs page types — section blueprints

Which quadrant a topic needs — and why mixing them fails — is `writing-standards`' call (Diátaxis). This file is the docs-site rendering of each: the section order to follow once the type is chosen.

## 1. Tutorial — learning by doing

The reader is new and wants a guaranteed win. You own every decision; they own nothing but the typing.

- Title: what they'll have built ("Build a comment feed with live updates")
- Opening: what the finished thing does and roughly how long it takes
- **Prerequisites** — exact versions, accounts, prior setup, each verifiable
- Numbered steps, each ending in something observable (output, a rendered page, a passing test) so the reader knows they're still on track
- Show expected output after every step that produces any
- No choices, no detours, no "alternatively" — one path
- Closing: what they built + next-steps links to the how-tos and concepts they're now ready for

## 2. How-to guide — a task for someone competent

The reader knows the basics and has a goal. Assume competence; skip teaching.

- Title: the task as they'd search it ("Rotate an API key")
- Opening: the goal and any preconditions, one or two sentences
- Numbered steps for the happy path, concrete values throughout
- Branches ("if you use X…") as short subsections, not interleaved into the main path
- The likely failure: the error they'll actually hit, what it means, the fix
- Closing: how to verify it worked

## 3. Reference — information, complete and neutral

The reader is mid-task and needs a fact. Structure mirrors the code, not a narrative.

- Title: the symbol or surface itself (`createClient()`, "Environment variables")
- One-line statement of what it is
- Tables for the matrix material: parameters, options, defaults, types, error codes — every entry, not the interesting ones
- A minimal runnable example per entry point
- No advice, no "you should usually…" — link the relevant how-to or explanation instead
- Generated API references (OpenAPI/Swagger) → `api-docs`, not hand-written pages

## 4. Explanation — understanding, no task

The reader wants to know why or how it works. No steps, no outcome.

- Title: the concept ("How caching works", "Why tokens expire")
- Opening: the question this page answers
- The mental model first, mechanics second, edge cases last
- Diagrams where the shape of the thing matters (→ `svg-generation`)
- Honest trade-offs — an explanation that only sells the design is marketing
- Closing: next-steps links to the how-tos that apply the concept

## The mixing test

A page drifting between types is the most common docs defect. Symptoms and fixes:

| Symptom                                            | The drift              | Fix                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| A tutorial offering choices ("or, if you prefer…") | tutorial → how-to      | Pick one path; move alternatives to a how-to              |
| A how-to explaining theory between steps           | how-to → explanation   | Cut to one sentence + link the explanation page           |
| A reference giving advice                          | reference → how-to     | Move the advice to the how-to; keep the reference neutral |
| An explanation with numbered steps                 | explanation → tutorial | Move the steps out; keep the why                          |
