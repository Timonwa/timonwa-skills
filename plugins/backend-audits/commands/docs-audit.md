description: >-
  Manually invoked. Documentation audit of a repo's docs site, doc pages, and READMEs — stale claims vs code, broken links and anchors, navigation integrity (orphaned pages, ghost entries), duplicated content, missing pages for the public surface, formatting/frontmatter consistency, README accuracy, and doc freshness vs recent code changes. Verifies each finding and writes a prioritized report. Not on by default. Self-contained; the house standards `docs-standards` and `writing-standards` are an optional enhancement. Part of the house audits family (see `audit-all`).

# Docs audit

A **manually-invoked, red-team documentation audit** of an app or a specific diff/PR. It is **self-contained** — every check is spelled out inline, so it runs a full review with zero other skills installed — and each finding is verified against the real code before it lands in a phase-aware, scored report at `_reports/docs-audit.md`.

> **Self-contained** — this checklist is comprehensive on its own and needs no other skill installed. Where the house standard(s) **`docs-standards`** and **`writing-standards`** ARE present, also apply their house-specific rules as an enhancement. Run the whole house audits family in one pass via **`audit-all`**.

## Arguments

- `[phase]` — `development` | `production`; sets the action-item tiers. Omitted → `production` (assume the app is live until told otherwise — the safer default).
- `[path]` — a file, directory, or PR/diff to scope the audit to; omitted → the whole repo.

## Audit protocol

**Mindset — reviewer/attacker first.** Don't assume code is fine because it looks careful; find the sequence that breaks it. Report only findings you can justify as real, each verified before it lands.

### Method

1. **Resolve phase** — use a phase arg (`development` | `production`) if given; else default `production` — assume the app is live with real users until told otherwise, so a CRITICAL finding gets Fix-Now urgency instead of a pre-launch discount. Phase sets the action-item tiers.
2. **Load the previous report** — if `_reports/docs-audit.md` exists, read it: carry unresolved findings forward (same ID, status `UNRESOLVED`), move fixed ones to "Resolved since last audit", and continue ID numbering. First run → skip Resolved and mark all `NEW`.
3. **Run the checklist** (below), collecting findings with `file:line` evidence.
4. **Verify** each candidate — construct the concrete failure/abuse case; drop what you can't show is real; mark uncertain ones "needs confirmation" rather than inflating.
5. **Write the report** to `_reports/docs-audit.md` (overwrite) and post the **chat summary** (see Output). Recommend fixes in the report; never modify code. Never commit or push without explicit approval.

### Severity

- **CRITICAL** — actively exploitable or broken now: data loss/leak, security breach, or total failure of the audited concern. Fix immediately.
- **HIGH** — a serious defect that will bite in production or blocks launch. Fix before shipping.
- **MEDIUM** — a real issue with a workaround or limited blast radius. Schedule it.
- **LOW** — minor, polish, or defense-in-depth.

Findings are ordered worst-first in the report.

### Report format

Write to `_reports/docs-audit.md`:

```
# Docs audit — <app/scope>

**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD> · **Phase:** <phase> · **Mode:** Report-only · **Branch:** `<branch>` · **Scope:** <what was audited> · **Overall:** <X>/10

## Score change (previous → current)
| Metric | Previous | Current | Δ | Trend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall | <prev/10 or N/A> | <cur/10> | <+N / -N / 0> | <▲ / ▼ / ■ / N/A> |

## Findings
| ID | Severity | Category | Status | Issue | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | HIGH | <category> | NEW | <one-line issue> | `file/path:line` |

### F1 — <title>
- **What:** <the defect, and the concrete evidence that proves it real>
- **Why it matters:** <impact / who it affects> <· optional standard or criterion ref, e.g. WCAG 2.1.2 / OWASP A01>
- **Fix:** <the specific remediation>

## Scorecard
| Category | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stale claims | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Links & URLs | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Navigation | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Duplication | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Coverage | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Consistency | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| README accuracy | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |
| Freshness | <X>/10 | <one-line justification> |

## Action items
Tiers by phase — `development` → **Fix Now / Before Launch / Post-Launch**; `production` → **Fix Now / Next Release / Backlog**. Each task references a finding ID.

### <Tier>
| # | Priority | Task (finding ID) | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Resolved since last audit
| ID | Issue | How it was resolved |
| --- | --- | --- |
```

### Output

Every run produces two things:

- **Full report** → `_reports/docs-audit.md`, in the format above, overwriting the prior run.
- **Chat summary** → a short recap posted in chat: the overall `<X>/10` (with Δ vs last run), a severity count (Critical / High / Medium / Low, i.e. C / H / M / L), the top findings worst-first (id · severity · one-line · `file:line`), and the report path. Note any "needs confirmation" items.

**Report-only** — this audit recommends fixes in the report; it never modifies code.

## Checklist

The criteria below are the audit's full working rules — self-contained. For house specifics, if installed → `docs-standards` and `writing-standards`. Audit every `.md`/`.mdx` surface: the docs-site content directory, READMEs at every level, and inline doc folders (`_docs/`, `docs/`).

### Stale claims

- **Docs vs code** — every documented command, CLI flag, API, config option, and env var still exists in the code with the documented name and behavior; flag docs describing removed or renamed surface.
- **Examples still valid** — code examples import from current paths and use current APIs; flag removed/renamed symbols and deprecated names in examples (old model names, dead package versions, retired flags).
- **Setup steps work** — install and quick-start commands match the current package manager, scripts, and entry points; a reader following them verbatim must succeed.
- **Version claims consistent** — runtime/tool version requirements (Node, package manager) say the same thing on every page and match what the repo enforces (`engines`, CI config); flag any page stating an older requirement.

### Links & URLs

- **Internal links and anchors resolve** — every relative link points at an existing page and every `#anchor` at an existing heading; flag links through renamed/moved files.
- **One canonical URL per destination** — repo, docs site, package registry, and community links each have one canonical form used everywhere; flag variants (wrong org casing, old domains, redirecting forms).
- **External links alive** — spot-check external links in high-traffic pages (README, getting-started) for 404s and dead redirects.

### Navigation

- **No ghost entries** — every page listed in the navigation config (`meta.json` / sidebar / nav file) exists as a real `.md`/`.mdx` file.
- **No orphaned pages** — every page file in the content directory appears in the navigation (index pages and intentionally hidden pages excepted); an unreachable page is unmaintained by definition.

### Duplication

- **One home per fact** — the same substantive content maintained in 2+ pages should live in one page that the others link; duplicated copies are drift waiting to happen. Flag near-identical sections across pages that aren't declared templated siblings.
- **Docs don't restate an owned standard** — a page that restates conventions owned elsewhere (a standards file, `AGENTS.md`, another doc) should link the owner instead.

### Coverage

- **Public surface is documented** — every exported API, CLI command, endpoint, and user-facing config option has a doc page or section; flag undocumented public surface.
- **Shipped features have pages** — features visible in recent history/releases that no doc mentions.

### Consistency

- **Frontmatter complete** — every docs-site page has the fields the site requires (at minimum `title` and `description`); flag missing ones.
- **One product name** — the product/brand written one canonical way in prose (no bare-abbreviation drift, no casing variants); the tagline identical wherever it appears.
- **Uniform formatting** — heading hierarchy starts at the right level and doesn't skip; callout/tab/card components used consistently for the same purpose across pages.

### README accuracy

- **Archetype compliance** — each README matches the repo's declared archetype for its location (root vs package vs app vs template): expected header, badges (or their intentional absence), and section set. Consistent-but-inadequate is still a finding: if the archetype itself omits what a reader needs (what it is, install/setup, usage), flag the archetype, not just drift from it.
- **Badges and metadata current** — badges point at the right package/pipeline; described commands exist in `package.json`.
- **Templated siblings in sync** — sibling READMEs generated from one template share their boilerplate sections without drift (only declared per-template substitutions differ).

### Freshness

- **Docs move with the code** — pages whose subject code changed significantly since the page was last touched (compare `git log` on both); flag high-churn areas with untouched docs.
- **No expired stubs** — "coming soon" / "stub — integration pending" / TODO notes that outlived the shipped feature.

## Boundaries

- **Report-only** — this audit recommends fixes in the report; it never modifies code.
- **Verify each finding is real** — construct the concrete case; drop what you can't show; mark uncertain ones "needs confirmation" rather than inflating.
- **Suggest fixes using the repo's existing helpers** — but only where those helpers themselves conform to the standard; when the repo's own convention is the violation, the suggestion is the standard, not a tidier copy of the drift.
- **Never commit or push without explicit approval.**
