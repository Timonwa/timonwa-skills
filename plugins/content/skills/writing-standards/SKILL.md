description: Use when writing or structuring developer documentation — guides, API references, explanations, tutorials, or deciding what kind of doc a topic needs. Triggers on "write docs", "document this", "API reference", "how-to guide", "explain this concept", "restructure these docs", "is this a tutorial or a guide". Owns the discipline — the Diátaxis quadrants (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation) and picking the right one, audience-first structure, prose before code, concrete over vague, plain language — and the shared house-voice checklist every writing skill links. Applies the same standard every run, in any project, rather than inheriting the surrounding docs' habits. Docs-site page mechanics (MDX, navigation, links) → `docs-standards`; help centres for non-technical readers → `help-center-standards`; project READMEs → `readme-standards`; polishing existing prose → `prose-editing`.

# Technical writing

The discipline of developer-facing documentation. Every document serves one reader, pursuing one goal, in one mode — decide who and which mode before writing a word.

## Pick the Diátaxis quadrant first

Every doc is exactly one of four types ([diataxis.fr](https://diataxis.fr/)). Pick one per document and don't mix — a mixed-mode doc fails all of its readers at once:

- **Tutorial — a lesson (learning-oriented).** Walks a newcomer to a guaranteed success. You own every decision — versions, names, values — so the reader only follows. Minimize choices and explanation; link out for "why".
- **How-to guide — a recipe (problem-oriented).** Steps for a reader who already knows what they want ("rotate an API key"). Assume competence: start from prerequisites, skip the teaching, get to the goal.
- **Reference — a dictionary (information-oriented).** Describes the machinery: parameters, types, returns, defaults, errors — complete, accurate, structured for lookup (tables over prose). Never narrative, never persuasive.
- **Explanation — a discussion (understanding-oriented).** Why things are the way they are: design decisions, trade-offs, background. No steps, no API listings.

**Fix mixing by moving, not deleting** — a tutorial that pauses to discuss architecture moves that discussion to an explanation page and links it; a reference entry with a walkthrough spins it out as a how-to; a how-to that teaches basics links the tutorial instead.

## Establish audience, goal, and scope before writing

- **Name the audience** — "novice developers new to the framework" vs "experienced operators", and write to exactly that level. Copy that tries to serve everyone serves no one.
- **State the reader's goal** — what they can do after reading that they couldn't before. Lead with that goal, not the feature; answer "why should I care" before "how it works".
- **Bound the scope** — decide what's excluded and link to where it lives, instead of letting the doc sprawl.
- **Outline before drafting** anything longer than one page — headings first, prose second; a bad structure can't be edited into a good doc.
- **Don't inherit the surrounding docs' habits.** Match a project's terminology for its own concepts, but not its shape or its voice — if the existing content has drifted (mixed modes, vague claims, passive filler), matching it copies the drift. Where what's there conflicts with these rules, say so and follow the rules.

> **The checkable rules live in [references/house-voice.md](references/house-voice.md)** — sentences, claims, code, structure, formatting, and keeping a document true. Every writing skill links that one copy; this section is the reasoning behind it.

## Writing principles

- **Plain language, active voice, present tense** — sentences under 25 words, one idea per paragraph, define a term on first use and then use exactly that term everywhere (never "delete" here and "remove" there).
- **Show, don't just tell** — every concept gets a complete, runnable example with its expected output, and the common failure case where one exists. No pseudocode, no `<PLACEHOLDER>` values.
- **Prose before code** — every code block is introduced by a sentence saying what it does and when to use it. A reader should understand the page with the code blocks collapsed.
- **Concrete over vague** — real numbers, names, and timeframes ("responds in under 200 ms", not "fast"; "retries 3 times", not "retries a few times"). If a claim can't be made specific, it's probably filler — cut it.
- **Progressive disclosure** — simple before complex, quickstart before deep dive; link advanced topics instead of inlining them, so beginners aren't buried.
- **Scannable structure** — descriptive headings that match what readers search for, bullets for 3+ items, tables for parameter/option/error matrices.
- **Accuracy is non-negotiable** — verify symbol names, signatures, defaults, and versions against the source, never from memory. Wrong docs are worse than no docs.

## Style

- **Address the reader as "you"**; use "we" only for genuinely shared actions; avoid "I" outside opinionated pieces. Conversational but professional.
- **Formatting has semantics** — **bold** for UI elements and buttons, `code` for commands, identifiers, and file names, _italics_ sparingly for emphasis.
- **Never hard-wrap prose** — one physical line per paragraph or list item; break only where Markdown semantics require it.

## Example

A how-to opening that obeys the rules — one mode, goal first, prose before code, concrete values, expected output:

````markdown
## Rotate an API key

Rotate a key when it may have leaked or on your regular schedule. Rotation issues a new key immediately; the old key keeps working for 24 hours so deployed clients don't break.

Create the replacement key with the CLI:

```bash
acme keys rotate --name production
```

The command prints the new key once — store it in your secret manager now, it is not retrievable later:

```text
Rotated key "production". New key: ak_live_9f2c… (old key expires in 24h)
```
````

Note what it doesn't do: no history of why API keys exist (explanation), no full flag listing (reference), no hand-holding about installing the CLI (tutorial) — those are links, not sections.

## Boundaries

- Docs-site page mechanics — MDX components and imports, navigation registration, link integrity when moving pages, page splitting, next-steps footers → `docs-standards`.
- Help-centre guides for non-technical end users → `help-center-standards`.
- Project READMEs → `readme-standards`.
- Standalone tutorials and blog articles are a different shape from a docs page — narrative, published off-repo, and not this skill's job.
- Tightening and polishing existing prose, including de-AI-ifying it → `prose-editing`.
- Auditing an existing docs site → `docs-audit`.
