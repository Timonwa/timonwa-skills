name: copy-editing
description: Use when editing, reviewing, or improving existing copy or prose — marketing pages, landing copy, UI text, docs passages, or an article draft. Triggers on "edit this copy", "review my copy", "proofread", "polish this", "tighten this up", "too wordy", "this reads awkwardly", "copy sweep", "sharpen the messaging", "does this sound AI-written". Runs focused passes — the seven sweeps (clarity, voice, so-what, proof, specificity, emotion, risk) for conversion copy, quick word/sentence-level checks for any prose, and an AI-tell pass (em-dash overuse, overused-word and phrase blacklists). For improving copy that exists, not writing from scratch — write the draft first, then edit here. The docs discipline → `writing-standards`; product/UI copy voice → `branding`.

# Copy editing

Systematically improve existing copy through focused passes while preserving the core message. Editing isn't rewriting — each pass fixes one dimension, because single-dimension passes catch what an everything-at-once review misses.

## Before editing

- **Establish the voice before touching a word** — edits land in the author's brand, not yours. Ask for the brand voice and vocabulary, or work from a style guide if one is handed over; where neither exists, infer the voice from the draft itself and say what you inferred.
- **Establish the goal, audience, and desired action** — you can't judge a claim without knowing who it's for and what it should make them do.
- **Read once without editing** — mark problem areas on the first pass; fix on the second.
- **Preserve the core message and the author's voice** — every edit needs a clear reason; enhance, don't replace.

## The seven sweeps (conversion copy)

For marketing/conversion copy, edit in seven sequential passes. After each sweep, re-check the earlier ones — a fix in one dimension can break another.

1. **Clarity** — can the reader understand it? Flag confusing structures, unclear pronouns, jargon, sentences doing too much, buried points. Confirm one main idea per section and that the copy speaks to the reader ("you").
2. **Voice and tone** — is it consistent? Read aloud; mark shifts between casual and corporate, jarring mood changes, mixed "we"/"the company", humor that appears and vanishes.
3. **So what** — does every claim answer "why should I care?" For each statement literally ask "so what?"; add the "which means…" bridge to a real reader benefit, or cut it. "AI-powered analytics" is a feature; "surface insights you'd miss manually, so decisions take half the time" answers the question.
4. **Prove it** — is every claim supported? "Trusted by thousands" (which thousands?), "industry-leading" (says whom?). Add named testimonials, numbers with sources, case references — or soften the claim.
5. **Specificity** — is it concrete enough to be compelling? Replace vague verbs (improve/enhance/optimize) and generic claims with numbers, timeframes, and examples ("save 4 hours a week", "response within 2 hours"). What can't be made specific is usually filler — cut it.
6. **Heightened emotion** — does it make the reader feel anything? Paint the before-state, use sensory language and micro-stories; emotion must serve the message, never manipulate.
7. **Zero risk** — is every barrier to action removed? Around the CTA: address the objections, add trust signals and risk reversals (guarantee, free trial, "no credit card", "cancel anytime"), make the next step explicit.

## Quick-pass checks (any prose)

For a fast review — or non-marketing prose like docs and articles — apply these directly:

- **Word level** — cut weak intensifiers (very, really, extremely, incredibly) and filler (just, actually, basically); replace corporate words with plain ones (utilize→use, leverage→use, facilitate→help, robust→strong, seamless→smooth); kill nominalizations ("make a decision"→"decide") and passive voice. Full substitution table in [Plain English alternatives](references/plain-english-alternatives.md).
- **Sentence level** — one idea per sentence, under 25 words usually, at most 3 conjunctions, important information front-loaded, varied lengths.
- **Paragraph level** — one topic each, 2–4 sentences for web, strong opening sentence, white space for scannability.

## The AI-tell pass

Run this on anything that will be published under a human's name — drafts written or heavily assisted by AI carry recognizable fingerprints. The full catalog (the em-dash tell, overused verb/adjective/transition tables, opening/transition/concluding phrase blacklists, filler intensifiers, self-check steps) is in [AI writing detection](references/ai-writing-detection.md); the short version:

- **Em dashes are the primary tell** — the flag is frequency and pattern, not the character: more than one per page is a signal; swap for commas, colons, or parentheses. A per-publication voice rule wins — where a house style mandates em-dash asides, keep the deliberate ones and flag only mechanical overuse.
- **Blacklisted vocabulary** — delve, leverage, robust, comprehensive, pivotal, seamless, transformative, "furthermore", "moreover"; replace from the tables in the reference.
- **Blacklisted phrases** — "In today's fast-paced world…", "It's worth noting that…", "At its core…", "In conclusion…", "Whether you're a X, Y, or Z…"; delete or rewrite as something a human would say aloud.
- **Self-check** — read it aloud; if you wouldn't say it to a colleague, revise it.

## Common problems and fixes

- **Wall of features** — add "which means…" after each feature to bridge to a benefit.
- **Corporate speak** ("leverage synergies to optimize outcomes") — ask "how would a human say this?" and use those words.
- **Weak opening** (company history, vague throat-clearing) — lead with the reader's problem or desired outcome.
- **Buried or vague CTA** — make the ask obvious, early, and specific; "Start your free trial", not "Click here to learn more".
- **Generic claims** ("we help businesses grow") — specify who, how, and by how much.
- **Mixed audiences** — pick one audience and write directly to them.
- **Feature overload** — keep the 3–5 benefits that matter most to that audience; cut the rest.
- **Vague testimonials** ("CloudSync is great!") — recommend specific results, context, and outcomes; suggest the questions to ask the customer. Never fabricate numbers — show a template of what a strong testimonial looks like instead.

## Working collaboratively

1. **Run a sweep and present findings** — what you found and why it's an issue.
2. **Recommend specific edits** — propose solutions, don't just flag problems.
3. **Let the author decide** — they own the copy.
4. **Re-verify earlier sweeps after each round**, and repeat until a full sweep finds nothing new.

## Boundaries

- **The house voice rules** — sentences, claims, prose-before-code, concrete-over-vague, no marketing adjectives, never hard-wrap → [`writing-standards`'s house-voice.md](../writing-standards/references/house-voice.md). This skill adds only what is specific to its own shape.
- Writing new copy from scratch is out of scope — this skill edits what exists; draft first, then edit here.
- The product's own UX/UI copy and brand voice definition → `branding`.
- Developer-docs structure and discipline (Diátaxis, audience, scope) → `writing-standards`.
