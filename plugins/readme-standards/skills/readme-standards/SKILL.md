description: >-
  Use when creating or updating a README for a project, package, or app — writing a new README.md, refreshing a stale one, or deciding what a README should contain. Triggers on "write a readme", "update the readme", "readme for this package", "document this repo", "add a readme to the monorepo root". Applies the same standard every run, in any repo — one fixed skeleton per repo type, and the skeleton wins over whatever an existing README happens to do. Detects the repo type (library / app / monorepo root / package / CLI / demo) and applies its shape plus the universal skeleton of a what-it-does one-liner, tested quickstart, config/env table, scripts, and license, under the house rules (lead with what it does, document the 20% people need, no marketing adjectives, keep it current or delete it). The writing discipline → `writing-standards`; the agent-facing sibling AGENTS.md → `scaffold-agents-md`.

# README standards

A README answers three questions, in order: what does this do, how do I run it, where is everything else. Everything that doesn't serve one of those three is a candidate for deletion.

This is the standard for every README, wherever it lives — a personal project, a work repo, or a pull request to someone else's. Same detection, same skeleton, same rules, every run. When a README already exists and deviates from it, keep the project-specific facts and correct the shape (see **Refresh, don't clobber**).

## Detect the repo type first

The right README shape depends on what the repo is — a library leads with install + usage, an app with what it does + local setup, a CLI with its top commands, a monorepo root is a map, a package inside one covers only itself. The detection signals and the full per-type skeletons (including the monorepo no-duplication rule and a worked CLI example) are in [references/repo-skeletons.md](references/repo-skeletons.md) — detect the type there before writing, and confirm with the user only when the signals conflict. A repo accompanying a tutorial (blog post or video) has its own shape — star callouts, branch variants, About metadata — and is not this skill's job.

## The universal skeleton

Every shape draws from the same skeleton, in this order. Drop a section that doesn't apply; never reorder:

1. **Title + one-liner** — what it does, in one sentence a stranger understands.
2. **Badges** — only if they carry information someone acts on (CI status, published version, license). No decorative badge walls; 4 badges max.
3. **Quickstart** — the shortest real path from clone/install to seeing it work.
4. **Config / env** — the variables needed to get running, with name, required-or-not, and what it's for. **Up to ~10, table them; past that, list only the required ones and point at `.env.example` for the rest.** A 40-row table buries the quickstart and becomes a second copy that drifts on the next commit — `.env.example` is the source of truth, and a README that reproduces it wholesale is signing up to keep two files in sync. If the project uses env vars but has no `.env.example`, flag that it needs one.
5. **Scripts table** — the `package.json` scripts a contributor actually runs (`dev`, `build`, `test`, anything non-obvious); skip internal plumbing scripts.
6. **Contributing pointer** — one line linking `CONTRIBUTING.md` or stating the workflow (issues, PRs, branch naming). Not a policy essay.
7. **License** — always present; link the `LICENSE` file.

## Rules

- **Lead with what it does, not what it is** — "Sorts files by size from the command line", not "filesort is a Python-based utility that was created to…". The first sentence earns the rest of the read.
- **The quickstart is tested verbatim** — run every command in it before shipping the README. If you can't run one (needs credentials, paid service), say so in the README and flag it to the user; never present untested commands as working.
- **Document the 20% people actually need** — the common path in full, everything else as a link (docs site, `--help`, generated API reference). A README is a front door, not the whole house.
- **Keep it current or delete it** — a stale README is worse than none, because readers trust it. When a change makes a section wrong, fix or remove that section in the same change; if a section can't be kept current, replace it with a link to the source of truth.
- **No marketing adjectives** — cut "blazing", "powerful", "seamless", "robust", "lightweight", "modern". State a concrete capability or number instead; if there's nothing concrete behind the adjective, there was nothing behind it at all.
- **Real values only** — infer names, commands, scripts, and env vars from the repo; never leave `<PLACEHOLDER>` tokens in the written file, and never invent features or env vars that aren't there.
- **Markdown lints clean** — one H1, no skipped heading levels, working relative links, and never hard-wrap prose (one physical line per paragraph or list item).
- **Refresh, don't clobber** — when a README exists, preserve its still-valid project-specific sections and update around them. Preserving content doesn't mean preserving violations: sections that break these rules (marketing adjectives, stale commands, duplicated setup) get corrected to this standard, and the file ends up in the skeleton's shape.

## Boundaries

- **The house voice rules** — sentences, claims, prose-before-code, concrete-over-vague, no marketing adjectives, never hard-wrap → [`writing-standards`'s house-voice.md](../writing-standards/references/house-voice.md). This skill adds only what is specific to its own shape.
- The general writing discipline (audience, plain language, prose-before-code) → `writing-standards`.
- Docs-site pages the README links out to → `docs-standards`.
- AGENTS.md — the agent-facing sibling documenting conventions for AI agents → `scaffold-agents-md`.
- Tightening the prose after drafting → `copy-editing-house`.
